A VB.Net Windows Forms memory matching game to find pairs among shuffled cards, using a Timer, a custom flat UI design and dynamic runtime-generated grids of cards at runtime, in structured scalable code.

Features
-------------------
* The game provides two difficulty levels, Easy and Hard, connected with different card grid sizes (4x4 and 6x6) and different time limits (1 and 2 minutes).
* The timer allows to display the time left on second intervals and determines the game over state when it runs out.
* The grids of cards are dinamically generated at runtime, not at design time, allowing for a scalable and reusable code for different game configurations.
* Cards are shuffled with a random function and compared to find matches during the game by tags, whereas game score points are counted on a powers-of-two basis as a tribute to the language of computers.
* Correct card picks and mistakes are counted and stored in variables for several purposes.
* Several visual cues are used on the UI to guide the user through game stages, such as a darker shade for disabled cards and a red font color for the timer when there are less than 20 seconds left.
* A brief delay of 900 ms pauses the thread when two unpaired cards are picked before turning them upside-down so the user has time to memorize their position.
* Custom different messages are displayed at the end of the game depending on the outcome.
